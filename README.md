## Introduction

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about candidates scheduled to take exams. The analysis includes identifying peak hours for exams, visualizing the distribution of exams between day and night, and categorizing candidates into various age groups.

### Task 1: Identify the Hour with the Highest Frequency of Scheduled Exams
We identify the hour with the highest frequency of candidates scheduled for exams and visualize the frequencies using a bar plot.


### Task 2: Stacked Bar Graph for Day and Night Exam Scheduling
We create a stacked bar graph showing the number of candidates taking exams during the day (06:00 AM to 09:00 PM) and at night (09:00 PM to 06:00 AM).


### Task 3: Frequency of Candidates in Different Age Groups

We categorize candidates into different age groups and calculate the frequency of candidates in each age group.
